The Harvey Needs API
====================

* Imports data from a public google data spreadsheet
  * Right now that's https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14GHRHQ_7cqVrj0B7HCTVE5EbfpNFMbSI9Gi8azQyn-k/edit#gid=0
* Each import does a full import of the needs and shelter sheets
* We serve JSON data here, open and fresh
* viasocket notifies our api when changes have been made to the source data in Google sheets. The api then does a full refresh of the data from the Google sheet.will post to us when an update is posted to the google spreadsheet
* An ad-hoc import can be triggered with `rails google:import`

Filters:

* `county` : County Name

* `shelter` : the name
* `lat` and `lon` : specify the lat / lon. We'll order by the lat/lon and return results within a 100 mile radius
* `limit`: only return n results



Sample:
`/api/v1/shelters?county=fort bend&accepting=true`

  * Filters by fort bend shelters accepting people

`/api/v1/shelters?shelter=Gallery`

  * Filters shelters with Gallery in the name

Getting Started (Dev)
-------
#### Prequisites
* Ruby 2.4.1
* Rails 5.1.


#### Fork Repository and clone to local machine
##### Fork Repository
* Prequisites
  * A github account and a repository into which to fork other repositories
* Steps
  1. Navigate in a browser to https://github.com/sketch-city/harvey-api
  2. Click the Fork button in the upper right of the screenshot_create-service-account-key
  3. If prompted choose into where you want to form (e.g., if you are a member of multiple github repositories)
  4. You'll now have a forked version - your own version - of the repository.
  5. Go to "Clone or download" button on right of screen and copy that URL. It will be of the format `git clone git@github.com:<YOUR OWN GITHUB REPOSITORY>/harvey-api.git`

##### Clone Fork to local box
* In the directory on your local box in which you plan to work run: `git clone git@github.com:<YOUR OWN GITHUB REPOSITORY>/harvey-api.git`

#### Setting up your .env file
You'll need to set the following ENV variables in a .env file

1. Make a working copy of .env by runng this command at the terminal: `cp .env.sample .env`
2. Edit the VARS
  * Atom users: `atom .env`
  * vim users: `vim .env`
  * emacs users: `emacs .env`
3. Get a server credential from google for
   https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/drive.googleapis.com/overview
   * Screenshot:  ![Screenshot](/public/images/readme/screenshot_create-service-account-key.png)

4. Get the private key and email from the json file google gets you
5. While still in the Google develop consoler enable the Google Sheets API. Once enabled it should look like this:
![Screenshot](/public/images/readme/screenshot_enable_google_sheets_api.png)
6. Back in the .env file now, replace the email value and private key values with the values in the JSON
  * Take care to copy the full private key which will span multiple lines.

#### Creating a local database
* Prerequisites
  * PostgreSQL is installed and running on your local machine
* Method 1: Automatic
  * Run `rails db:setup`
* Method 2: Manual
  * Create a postgres users
    It's recommended though optional that you use a distinct user for the harvey-api database
    * Example `createuser harvey-api_development -P`
    The `-P` flag will prompt you to create a password for the new user
  * Create the database (with the owner of the database set to user just created in the last step)
    * Example `createdb -O harvey-api_development harvey-api_development`
* Run rails migrate to create schema
  * `rails db:migrate`
* Test it's working by doing an initial import from the Google Sheet
  * `rails google:import`
  Sample output if successful
  ```
    Starting ImportSheltersJob 2017-09-01 23:32:10 -0400
    ImportSheltersJob Complete - {282}
    Starting ImportNeedsJob 2017-09-01 23:32:12 -0400
    ImportNeedsJob Complete - {89}
  ```

* Test the API itself (Run API locally)
  * Example `rails server `
  Screenshot of Success:
  ![Screenshot](/public/images/readme/screenshot_rails_server_run_test.png)



Development Process
-------
#### Tests and Testing
Code should have tests, and any pull requests should be made only after you've made sure passes the test suite

#### Git and Github use
We force pull-requests from feature branches to master. Once something lands in master, it goes live instantly

##### Keeping your fork in sync
* `git remote add upstream git@github.com:sketch-city/harvey-api.git`
* `git fetch upstream`

#### Branching
Within your own forked repo create branches for each logical unit for work you do. One benefit of doing this is you'll be able to periodically sync your forked repo with upstream repo into the master branch without conflicting with work you may be doing.

#### Pull Requests
When you believe your code is ready to be merged into the upstream repository (sketch-city/harvey-api) by creating a pull request. Do this by
* In github click the "Compare & pull request" button that github will present to you once you've committed changes to local repo
* Describe what you changed and why; reference the issue(s) if any that your work addresses

##### More Information and Further Reading
* More information about keeping your fork in sync with the upstream repository may be found at https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/
* More information about branching can be found at https://git-scm.com/book/id/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell


Documentation Standards
-------
### Inline Comment Style
(Coming Soon)

### Markdown
Documentation such as READMEs (e.g., this document) are written in markdown per the [Github standard] (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)


Design Choices
-------------

* one benefit of building our own api is so that we can get rid of using google-sheets eventually.
* Hosted on Heroku and Amazon RDS

Thanks To:
---------

* Entire Sketch-City organization
* Coding for America
* More More More names here

### Errors you may get and what they mean
* Could not load default credentials
Looks like:
```rails aborted!
Could not load the default credentials
```
You either have not set up a key OR did not configure it correctly in your .env file

* "accessNotConfigured: Google Sheets API"
Looks like:
```rails aborted!
Google::Apis::ClientError: accessNotConfigured: Google Sheets API has not been used in project harvey-api before or it is disabled. Enable it by visiting https://console.developers.google.com/apis/api/sheets.googleapis.com/overview?project=harvey-api then retry. If you enabled this API recently, wait a few minutes for the action to propagate to our systems and retry.
```
You set up a key properly in the Google console but you did not enable Google sheets.

* "PG::ConnectionBad"
Looks like:
```rails aborted!
PG::ConnectionBad: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
	Is the server running locally and accepting
	connections on Unix domain socket "/tmp/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```
Postgres is not running OR there is a connection problem to the database.
